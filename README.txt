Help! Help! 
We need you help Rizzler. The most chill and evil villain Chill Guy, who was once a part of our brainrot community has turned evil and destroyed many security measures on the system. Your job is simple, fix the vulnerabilities in the system and restoring the trust for the rest of the community. Make sure to kick that traitor Chill Guy out and remove all remnants of him on the system. We are counting on you.

Here is some important information. This is running on Mint 21, system updates are not necessary(aren't scored) and the kernel is to stay the same version as is. Do not change the root users password and DO NOT TOUCH THE SCOREBOT SCRIPT LOCATED IN /etc/scoring/getscore.sh AS THE SCOREBOT WILL BREAK!!!! The user diddy should be moved from the diddy party group to the prison group.

Critical Services:

SSH(openssh)

FTP(vsfptd)

Squid(Squid Proxy Server)

Along with these the auditd service is also integral to the system. All critical services should be enabled to run on startup and configured properly for maximum security.

SSH should be configured to use key-based authentication and connections should only use the IPv4 addresses

FTP on this server loves to hang around port 50000-50200. FTP should use secure TLS connections. Anonymous FTP users shouldn't be allowed on the system and shouldn't able to do anything if there are anonymous users.
